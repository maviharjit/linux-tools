# cluster execute
# when you want to execute a command on multiple server using ssh

lets say i have servers names like below and ssh is set up with key based authentication
myserver01 to myserver10

Tip: do on number 10 manualy for proof of concept. then cluster execute 1 to 9

# test my loop construct
for i in `seq 2 9`; do echo myserver0$i; done

# test by querying something read only
for i in `seq 2 9`; do ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no myserver0$i uptime; done

# real deal. eg. copy a file to other servers
for i in `seq 2 9`; do scp /tmp/some-file.zip myserver0$i:/tmp ; done

# make it better by writing a bash script though that allows pre screened commands to run remotely
